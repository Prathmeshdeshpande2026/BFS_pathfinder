# BFS_pathfinder

Project Overview
The BFS Pathfinder is a Python project that implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid or graph. This project serves as a practical demonstration of the BFS algorithm and can be used for educational purposes to understand graph traversal and pathfinding concepts.

Features
BFS Algorithm Implementation: Efficiently finds the shortest path in unweighted grids or graphs.
Visual Representation: A graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the grid and the pathfinding process.
User Interaction: Allows users to set start and end points and visualize the pathfinding in real time.
Customizable Grid Size: Users can specify the dimensions of the grid.
Technology Stack
Language: Python
GUI Library: Tkinter (built-in Python library)
Data Structures: Lists and Queues for BFS implementation
Screenshots
(Include screenshots showing the application interface and pathfinding in action.)

Prerequisites
Python 3.x must be installed on your system.
To check if Python is installed, run:

bash
Copy code
python --version
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bfs_pathfinder.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd bfs_pathfinder
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python bfs_pathfinder.py
Usage
Start the Application: Once you run the program, a window will open displaying a grid.

Set Start and End Points:

Click on a cell in the grid to set it as the starting point.
Click on another cell to set it as the endpoint.
Customize the Grid Size: If applicable, use the provided controls to adjust the grid size.

Run BFS: Click the "Find Path" button to begin the BFS pathfinding visualization.

View Results: The algorithm will visually demonstrate the pathfinding process, highlighting the cells explored and the final path from the start to the end point.

How BFS Works
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node) and explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

BFS Algorithm Steps:
Initialize a queue and add the starting point.
Mark the starting point as visited.
While the queue is not empty:
Dequeue a node from the front.
Check if it is the target node:
If yes, reconstruct the path and return it.
Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited.

Future Improvements
Add support for weighted graphs.
Implement additional pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s, A*).
Enhance the GUI with more customization options.
Allow users to add obstacles to the grid.
