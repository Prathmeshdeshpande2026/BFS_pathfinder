# BFS Pathfinder

Overview
BFS Pathfinder is an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid. The project demonstrates how BFS, a graph traversal algorithm, can be applied to solve pathfinding problems. BFS guarantees that the shortest path (in terms of number of edges or steps) between a start and an end node is found.

Features
Implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
Finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
Visually demonstrates the BFS pathfinding process.
Customizable grid size, start, and end points.
Option to add obstacles and barriers to the grid.
BFS Algorithm Overview
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to visit, ensuring that it processes nodes in the order they were added.

Characteristics of BFS:
Guaranteed Shortest Path: BFS always finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid or graph.
Uses a Queue: The algorithm works with a queue data structure, ensuring a level-wise exploration of the grid.
Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
How It Works
Start from a given node (source node).
Explore all its neighbors.
Mark each explored node and keep track of its parent to reconstruct the path later.
Repeat the process level by level until the destination node is reached.
If the destination is found, trace back the path from the destination to the source.
Use Cases
Pathfinding in mazes.
Shortest path problems in unweighted graphs.
Grid-based games or simulations.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x (if implementing in Python)
Any required libraries like matplotlib (for visualizations) or pygame (for game-like grid visualization)
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BFS_pathfinder.git
cd BFS_pathfinder
Install dependencies (if applicable):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the BFS Pathfinder:

bash
Copy code
python bfs_pathfinder.py
Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how the BFS Pathfinder works:

python
Copy code
from bfs_pathfinder import bfs, Grid

# Define the grid size
grid = Grid(width=10, height=10)

# Define start and end points
start = (0, 0)    # Top-left corner
end = (9, 9)      # Bottom-right corner

# Find the shortest path
path = bfs(grid, start, end)

# Output the path
print("Shortest path:", path)
Customization
Grid Size: Change the dimensions of the grid to fit your problem's size.
Obstacles: Add obstacles or barriers to the grid to simulate real-world scenarios (like walls in a maze).
Visualization: Integrate a visualization tool to observe how the BFS algorithm explores the grid in real time.
